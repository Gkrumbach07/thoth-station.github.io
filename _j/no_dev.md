title: Development dependencies will not be taken into account
---

Development dependencies (if any stated) will be used during the resolution
process.

## Issue description

The resolution process will not take into account development dependencies.
This is suitable to reduce the size of [the state space of software stacks
checked][2] and narrow down the resolution process to better results for
packages used for running the application.

If you wish to have your development dependencies resolved, you can pass
``--dev`` dependencies to Thamos CLI:

```console
thamos advise --dev
```

Alternatively, you can set ``THAMOS_DEV=1`` environment variable:

```console
export THAMOS_DEV=1
thamos advise
```

Note this can add significant overhead to the resolution process. See [Thamos
documentation for more info][1].
