title: TensorFlow in version 2.3 produces wrong model accuracy when the model is accuracy
---

TensorFlow in version 2.3 produces wrong model accuracy when the model is
serialized using `accuracy`, use `sparce_categorical_accuracy` instead

## Issue description

TensorFlow in version 2.3 fails to serialize the model properly. This resolves
in bad model accuracy when the model is loaded back. The issue is caused by a
bug in `accuracy` which has been already [resolved in more recent versions][1].

To avoid this issue, make sure you use `sparce_categorical_accuracy` instead if
`accuracy` when compiling the model.

## Affected packages:

 * ``tensorflow==2.3``

## Severity

 * WARNING

## Issue fix

Compile the model using `sparce_categorical_accuracy` instead of just `accuracy`:

```patch
- model.compile(..., metrics=['accuracy'])
+ model.compile(..., metrics=['sparce_categorical_accuracy'])
```

## Pipeline units

 * [TensorFlow23Accuracy](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/adviser/thoth.adviser.wraps.html#module-thoth.adviser.wraps.tf_accuracy)
