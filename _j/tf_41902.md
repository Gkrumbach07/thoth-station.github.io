title: TensorFlow <2.3>=2.0 states NumPy<2.0.0 as a dependency, but is compatible with NumPy<1.19.0
---

NumPy in versions >=1.19.0<2.0.0 has a breaking ABI change making it
incompatible with TensorFlow in versions <2.3>=2.0.

## Issue description

TensorFlow releases matching version range specification <2.3>=2.0 stated
NumPy<2.0.0 as a dependency. A new release 1.19.0 of NumPy [introduced a
breaking change][1] which made the version range specification of TensorFlow
not valid for a more recent NumPy releases.

## Affected packages:

 * ``tensorflow>=2.0<2.3``
 * ``tensorflow-cpu>=2.0<2.3``
 * ``tensorflow-gpu>=2.0<2.3``
 * ``intel-tensorflow>=2.0<2.3``
 * ``numpy>=1.19.0<2.0.0``

## Severity

 * WARNING

## Issue fix

The recommendation engine will try to resolve a software stack with a
compatible NumPy release without ABI breaking change.

## Pipeline units

 * [TensorFlow22NumPyStep](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/adviser/thoth.adviser.steps.html#thoth.adviser.steps.TensorFlow22NumPyStep)

## Recommendation types

All the recommendation types can produce this warning message, except for latest:

 * performance
 * security
 * stable
 * testing

See [this document that describes recommendation types
listed](http://thoth-station.ninja/recommendation-types).
