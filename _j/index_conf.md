---

The given package was removed based on package source indexes configured.

## Issue description

The given package was removed based on package sources configured.

The configuration is done in Pipfile:

```toml
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[[source]]
url = "https://tensorflow.pypi.thoth-station.ninja/index/manylinux2010/AVX2/simple/"
verify_ssl = true
name = "aicoe-tensorflow"

[packages]
tensorflow = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.9"

[thoth]
disable_index_adjustment = true
```

In the example above, only ``aicoe-tensorflow`` and ``pypi`` package sources
will be used for obtaining packages.  See [Thoth's strict indexes
configuration][1].
