title: TensorFlow in versions >=2.1<=2.3 stated SciPy as a dependency but it is not used in the codebase
---

Even though SciPy is stated in the requirements of TensorFlow>=2.1<=2.3, it is
not used in TensorFlow's codebase.

## Issue description

TensorFlow releases matching version specification >=2.1<=2.3 stated [SciPy][9]
package as a dependency. This dependency is used only in TensorFlow testsuite
and is not used when running TensorFlow as a library.

The installation process time can be affected negatively as SciPy can trigger
building native extensions. Moreover, shipping the application with code that
is not used has additional disadvantages.

## Affected packages:

 * ``tensorflow>=2.1<=2.3``
 * ``tensorflow-cpu>=2.1<=2.3``
 * ``tensorflow-gpu>=2.1<=2.3``
 * ``intel-tensorflow>=2.1<=2.3``
 * ``scipy==1.4.1``
 * ``scipy==1.2.2``

## Severity

 * WARNING

## Issue fix

Resolver will automatically remove SciPy and all its dependencies from
the application dependencies if the application does not use this package
(directly or indirectly using other dependencies).

## Pipeline units

 * [TensorFlowRemoveSciPyStep](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/adviser/thoth.adviser.steps.html#thoth.adviser.steps.TensorFlowRemoveSciPyStep)
